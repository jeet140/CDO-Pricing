# CDO-Pricing
This project focuses on pricing N-th-to-default collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) using Monte Carlo simulation with a Gaussian copula model. It calculates 95% confidence intervals to ensure statistical accuracy in the estimated CDO price. Risk assessment is performed through Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR), providing insights into potential losses. The project also computes Delta and Gamma to evaluate the sensitivity of the CDO price to changes in default probability. Finite difference approximations are employed to refine Delta and Gamma estimates, enhancing the precision of the risk metrics and overall pricing accuracy.
